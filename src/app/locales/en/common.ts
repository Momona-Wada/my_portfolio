        "Thank you for visiting my portfolio!\n" +
        "I'm a junior IT engineer currently living in Canada for the fourth year. I completed the Computer Systems Technology program at BCIT in May 2025 and am currently seeking job opportunities.\n" +
        "At BCIT, I chose the Predictive Analytics option, where I worked on data analysis, model building, and creating documentation based on the results. I believe that building a model is not the end goal ‚Äî clearly organizing and documenting the outcomes is just as important. I enjoy and excel at this process of turning insights into structured, written materials.\n" +
        "My strengths include smooth communication within teams, strong time management skills, and the ability to consider others' perspectives when working. I always strive to handle tasks and projects with care while being considerate of both clients and team members.\n" +
        "In this portfolio, you'll find the projects I‚Äôve worked on and a few of my personal interests. I hope you enjoy exploring it! üòä",

After performing exploratory data analysis, several ensemble learning methods (Random Forest, Bagging, Voting, Stacked models) and Logistic Regression were applied to predict whether an animal would be adopted, returned to its owner, or experience other outcomes (e.g., transfer or euthanasia). The Random Forest model achieved the highest accuracy (92.2%) and was selected as the preferred model. Key features such as age, intake type, fixed (spay/neuter) status, and length of stay were found to significantly influence outcomes. This project emphasizes data-driven solutions to improve shelter decision-making.",
